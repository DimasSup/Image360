# What is this?

Greetings.

Image360 is a simple stack of Image360Controller + Image360View which allows you to display 360° images

## How to use it?
- Create an instance of `Image360Controller` in your code.
- Set 360° image as `image: UIImage` of just created instance.
- If it is necessary, set up the `inertia: Inertia` of just created instance.

For more details look at "iOS Example" in this repository.
